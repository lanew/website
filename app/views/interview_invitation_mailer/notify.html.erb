Hello <%= @enrollment.first_name %>!

Let's get together some time this week so I can answer any questions you may have about the experience at Devschool and determine if you are a good culture fit for the school.

Our method is a little different from the rest of the developer bootcamps. At the Devschool we try a lot less hard to give you a 'school' experience and much harder to give you a feel for what it is actually like to be a Jr. Web Developer.

Instead of learning from a book, you will learn from many different sources and you will immediately put that learning to use by building a real life web application of your own choosing.

During your education at the Devschool you will flush out your application, adding features, making it look pretty and even launching it. As you need to learn specific things you jump into those topics. If you cannot think of what kind of web application to build, your Instructor will help you choose something that interests you.

While you are at the Devschool you will collaborate with other students as well as with your Instructor who will be guiding you through the creation of your web app several times a week. By the end of your first week you will already start to become comfortable with pair programming and writing code in your console, just like a real hacker would!

Through a combination on your private one on one sessions each week where your Instructor will show you, rather than tell you, how to build your web application features, and the group sessions that happen throughout the week, and the pair programming you will do with like minded students, you will become a web developer and be ready to get placed with either one of our Non Profit Partners (NGO) or even in the private sector.

At Devschool, we pride in not just training you, but getting you hired into that first position on into your new life as a web developer! Now let's get started!

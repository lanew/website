    <h2>Questions from people just like you!</h2>
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <p>Since we opened the doors in January of 2015 we have gotten a few questions via online chat and in email. We have compiled the greatest hits list so to speak and hopefully it will help answer any additional questions you may have. See you soon!</p>

      <h2>What is your "Enrollment to Hire" Guarantee all about?</h2>

      <p>We maintain relationships with many non and for profit companies as part of two programs here at Devschool. One is to get you that first job when you graduate with one of our partners, and the other is to get you in front of them even before you graduate. That is one of the reasons our curriculum includes 120 hours of NGO service where you pair on real projects helping real people!</p>

      <h2>Why is your school so much cheaper than the "big" Bootcamps</h2>

      <p>The biggest of these bootcamps require a physical location and a large faculty to get anything done. They also require giant marketing budgets to get the word out. That physical location of course needs to be be trendy, nice, comfortable, what have you. All of that greatly increases their costs to operate, and therefore, your costs to attend such a school go way up!</p>

      <h2>Why is your school also cheaper than the other online Bootcamps?</h2>

      <p>The online Devschool is a school created by an award winning, life-long professional web developer who knows over a dozen programming languages. This is a school BY programmers and web developers FOR programmers and web developers.</p>

      <p>We have no managers, and we require that everyone working at Devschool must directly enhance the experience of the students. Since we do not have the overhead of all of a lot staff we can pass those savings directly to you!</p>

      <h2>Do you have an HR department</h2>

      <p>We do!, let me introduce you to H. Mae Watson, employee #2 and an awesome advocate for the Students! She is who you would go to if you need any sort of conflict resolution or feedback about your experience in the course.</p>

      <p>Jim takes a School Culture, Student Happiness, and Instructor Accountability serious, which is why the very second person to join the team had extensive experience in Human Resource.</p>
      <h2>How does the billing work?</h2>

      <p>Our enrollment form is processed through Stripe, meaning we do not store any of your credit card information on any of our servers, instead that is all handled by our payment processing partner, Stripe.</p>

      <p>If you choose to pay your enrollment up front you will save a little over $1000 off your total enrollment price, however, you can elect to make 5 payments instead and Stripe will auto-bill you each month for your payment until you have no balance. The payments happen on the same day each month. The actual pricing can be found on the homepage, <a href="https://onlinedevschool.com/#curriculum" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

      <h2>How many students are there in a class?</h2>

      <p>We don't use the cohort system here. We are not trying to replicate high school or college with courses like programmer empathy and other filler social topics with little to do with programming. You can do that at a community college, a place where you can't learn this stuff, so we feel it is a fair trade.</p>

      <p>There are no classrooms and your study is a mix of self study and work and pair programming.</p>

      <h2>What is "Pair Programming"</h2>

      <p>Pair programming is the practice of having more than one person work on the same computer doing the same tasks, kind of like a pilot and a navigator. Much of the time this will be your instructor, however as part of your study at the online Devschool you must complete a certain number of pair programming hours with other students.</p>

      <h2>Do I need a web cam to attend?</h2>

      <p>No. Video is not required at all. Audio only is perfectly fine and generally preferable to keep focused and to save bandwidth for more important things.</p>
